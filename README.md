# Artificial-Intelligence-Search-Algorithms
This project implements various global and local search algorithms used in artificial intelligence in order to navigate a treasure island

# Global Search Algorithms Implemented:
- Uniform cost search
- Best first search
- Greedy best first search
- A* search

Global search algorithms are implemented in part A (captain.py).

# Local Search Algorithms Implemented:
- Hill chilmbing search
- Stochastic hill climbing search
- Boltzmann simulated annealing search

Local search algorithms are implemented in part B (pirate.py).

To run these algorithms against the test cases, use:
python test.py
